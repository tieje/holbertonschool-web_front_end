The checker won't be released until tomorrow.
The directions are getting less clear as the questions go on.
Each question depends on the last one's answer, so it would be less work in the future if I did not work on it until the checker is released.
I reached the goal of completing more than 15 questions today.
I will stop here for now and resume work on this project in the 3 - 5pm block tomorrow when the checker is released.
In the meantime, I will work on my side project for the 3 - 5pm block today and the 8 - 12pm block tomorrow.
